# NTC_FanControl_Arduino
Arduino-NTC-FanController simulates a temperature-controlled fan using Arduino and a potentiometer as a 10k NTC thermistor in Tinkercad. The system reads simulated temperature, maps it to 0–50 °C, and controls a fan (LED) with PWM: OFF below 25 °C, Half ON between 25–30 °C, and Full ON above 30 °C.
